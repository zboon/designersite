        <p><i>Dervishood tells me, you cannot become a dervish
            So what can I tell you? You cannot become a dervish.
            A dervish needs a wounded heart and eyes full of tears.
            He needs to be as easygoing as a sheep - you can't be a dervish.
            He must be without hands when someone hits him, without tongue when cursed;
            the dervish should be without self – you cannot be a dervish.
            You make a lot of sounds with your tongue, meaningful things
            you get angry about this and that - you can't be a dervish.
            If it were all right to be angry on this path,
            Muhammad himself would have got angry
            As long as you take offence, you cannot be a dervish.
            Unless you find a real path, unless you find a guide,
            unless Truth grants you your portion, you can't be a dervish.
            Dervish Yunus, come, dive into the ocean now and then,
            unless you dive into the ocean, you cannot be a dervish</i></p>
